HLML CHANGELOG

v2.0.?????, <INSERT RELEASE DATE HERE>:
	`*_unary` has been renamed to `*_not` because that's what it actually does.

v2.0.1, 12/02/2022:
	* Re-added `negate` function and operator after it was accidentally removed during the re-write between v1 and v2 (oops).

v2.0.0, 11/02/2022:
	* Everything has been rewritten from scratch.
		* The old generator codebase was clearly not easy to work in at all and could be very confusing at times.  The new generator codebase addresses all of those concerns.
	* The C and C++ APIs have been split for better usability, but unfortunately this does mean that you can no longer use both the C and C++ APIs in your project together.
	* Added `any` and `all` functions, which do the same thing as in HLSL.
	* Added `quat_to_rotation_matrix` function.
	* Added the rest of the missing vector swizzle functions.
		* The previous implementation was poor and did not cover all possible permutations.
	* All arithmetic operator overloads now do their component-wise function.
		* Therefore, `float4x4::operator*` no longer performs matrix multiplication, but rather component-wise multiplication.
			* For matrix multiplication you will now have to call `mul` (or `float4x4_mul` in the C API, for example).
			* This was done for consistency across the API and to avoid a common pitfall.
	* `lookat` has been renamed to `look_at`.
	* Removed a bunch of maths functions that were redundant:
		* Removed component-wise functions in the C++ API when their operator counterparts existed (E.G.: `caddv` -> `operator+`).  Use those instead.
		* `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()` are now only for 4x4 matrices.
		* Matrices no longer have a constructor that takes an array of row-types.
	* Removed forward declarations for all functions because they were unnecessary.
	* Removed the doxygen-styling on all comments in the API because it was just ugly.
	* A lot of SSE functionality has been removed.
		* The SSE abstraction types (E.G.: `float2_sse_t`) have been removed due to causing aliasing.
		* Removed support for all SSE register types except `__m128`.
			* I suspect no-one needs any of the other types, but if you do then let me know.
		* A lot of the vector functions have been removed due to performance concerns and lack of practicality.
		* ALL of the matrix functions have been removed due to performance concerns.
			* A new, better API for matrices will be implemented at some point.
		* If you need any of the old functionality that was removed then let me know.
	* Removed macOS support for the generator.
		* I don't have a Mac, so I was basically writing a Mac generator only for a Travis VM.  This isn't ideal.
		* If I can get access to a Mac at some point I will maybe sit down and write one then.
		* If someone else wants to go ahead and add Mac support for me (but ONLY if you have access to actual hardware!) then go ahead.
	* Re-wrote the tests to use Temper 2's parametric testing functionality.
		* There are now A LOT more tests running, whereas before we had around 1,000 tests in the C++ side we now have over 5,500.

v1.1.1, 28/10/2020:
	* Add extern "C" { ... } wrappers for each header file in the C API.
	* Remove Doxygen documentation because:
		* No-one seemed to care about it.
		* Maintaining that part of the generator was more work than it was worth.  If you want Doxygen documentation you'll have to do it yourself from now on.  The external-facing comments are Doxygen compliant, so all you need to do is run Doxygen.

v1.1.0, 03/02/2020:
	* Removed the HLML_IMPLEMENTATION define as it's simply not needed for an all-inlined library.  Now you only need to simply include the main header to use HLML.
	* Maths types no longer default-initialise to all zeros and will now need to be handled by the user, if desired.
	* Replaced quaternion_to_matrix for quaternion_rotate_matrix.
	* Other minor fixes to the documentation, tests, and quaternions.
	* Fixed the make_release scripts to actually generate .zip files correctly (Thanks @xwize).

v1.0.0, 01/12/2019:
	* The library is now included by including one of two headers: hlml/c/hlml.h or hlml/cpp/hlml.h.  In one source file you must also define HLML_IMPLEMENTATION so that all the function bodies can be defined (this works the same as the STB libraries).
	* Quaternion functions (courtesy of @Flave229).
	* Better SSE support (still experimental for now but it's looking good).
	* SSE constants are now #defines instead of actual constants (this is for compatibility with the C API).
	* C99 functions that are completely separate from the C++ functions.
	* C++ vector/matrix functions no-longer rely on operator overloads. This means that the C++ operator overloads are completely separate from functions.  This means that hlml_operators_vector.h and hlml_operators_matrix.h can be removed from the codebase if desired.
	* Function-counterparts for C++ overloaded operators (there's a chance we are missing some for now - these will be added, if any).

v0.4.0, 06/07/2019:
	* This release comes with only some minor additions and updates to the maths library itself, this version adds:
		* step() function.
		* comp_mul() and comp_div() functions for the missing component-wise arithmetic functionality for matrix types.
	* The generator has also been re-written to not use the STL at all.  The generator now uses a linear allocator and string builders to write out strings.  The time taken to generate the maths library code has now more than halved; from ~270ms to ~120ms.

v0.3.1, 25/05/2019:
	* Boolean vectors/matrices now use a 4-byte boolean type.

v0.3.0, 25/05/2019:
	* Ensured that everything builds for MSVC, not promising optimal ASM though (and I probably never will, because I don't care for MSVC).
	* length() and lengthsqr() will now return float.
	* dot() now returns the appropriate type for each vector (except uint vectors, where it returns an int).
	* Fixed up some stuff in the tests (you don't really care about that...do you?)

v0.2.0, 21/04/2019:
	* Fixes a series of warnings for Clang and GCC.  SIMD still not included in this release, but it's on its way.
	* Hotfix to remove broken isinf/isnan functions.  I never knew they were part of C99, those should now be used.

v0.1.0, 31/03/2019:
	* Initial release.
